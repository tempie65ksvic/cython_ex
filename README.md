# Example code in Cython

A simple example program in Cython showing its syntax, including static types and use of C built-in functions.  

## Notes:

- `cython: language_level=3` indicates using Python 3 syntax.
- `cdef` is used to declare static types.
- `malloc` and `free` are C language functions used to allocate and free dynamic memory.
- `int[:]` is a statically typed C array.
- The `calculate_square` and `allocate_and_fill_array` functions provide examples of the use of static types.
